# Part D Solution

## Problem Statement
Programming the robot to deliver parcels, navigating traffic, turns, and obstacles.

## Solution
Using a combination of sensor data (gyroscopes, accelerometers, LiDAR), control algorithms (PID), and pathfinding algorithms (A* or Dijkstra's) to program the robot for autonomous navigation.

## Code
The related code can be found in the `code/` directory.
