# Part A Solution

## Problem Statement
What are the parameters that should be considered while calculating the maximum angle of inclination in Two-wheeled self-balancing robots (TWSBR)?

## Solution
- Center of Gravity (CoG)
- Mass of the robot
- Position and force of wheels
- Sensor accuracy (gyroscopes and accelerometers)
- Surface conditions and friction
- Motor torque and response time

## Code
The related code can be found in the `code/` directory.
