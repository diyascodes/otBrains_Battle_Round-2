# Part C Solution

## Problem Statement
What is the additional thing/component that you can add to make it unique and explain the same by giving its proof of concept?

## Solution
Adding a LiDAR sensor for advanced obstacle detection and navigation. LiDAR provides precise distance measurements which can be integrated into the robot's control system to navigate complex environments more effectively.

## Proof of Concept
Integrating LiDAR with the robot's existing sensors and control systems, and demonstrating improved navigation and obstacle avoidance in a simulated environment.

## Code
The related code can be found in the `code/` directory.
