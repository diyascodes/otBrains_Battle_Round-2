# Part B Solution

## Problem Statement
What is the core concept of the Two-wheeled self-balancing robots (TWSBR)?

## Solution
The core concept of TWSBR involves using sensors like gyroscopes and accelerometers to detect the robot's orientation and maintain balance by adjusting the wheel movements accordingly. This involves sophisticated control algorithms like PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) to continuously correct the robot's position.
